This is the first iteration of my personal website, built using a Bootstrap template to showcase my skills and projects. While this version effectively highlights my work, I later opted to develop a new version from scratch to allow for greater customization. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with more advanced CSS configurations, including implementing color gradients and optimizing layout responsiveness.
